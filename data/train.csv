It's a small boutique, so it's one client at a time.  We can close the door to be more private too.  She has a candy bowl and if he's good and sits, he can choose so many candies.  I have to spray his hair down first and comb it through (mommy's touch).  He doesn't like anyone else trying to delta glue his hair.  We have been consistent about getting his haircut.  It has been a work in progress.  When we first started, he would scream and squirm.  Little by little, we have worked up to a little boy who hops into that chair all on his own, gets the smock on and towel tucked in the back without any issues.  It's so nice.We've been consistent on the dentist as well and have taken him since he was a baby.  We actually have a dental appt. this afternoon today.  We've seen the same dentist now for 3-4 visits as our insurance changed two years ago.  This is a family practice, but it's more adult. There aren't cutie animal pics or children's videos like at his last pediatric dentist.  It's more formal and I bring the iPAD or a book.  We tell him what to expect: the dentist is going to count your teeth, brush them with a special toothbrush and flavor, and maybe take a picture.
