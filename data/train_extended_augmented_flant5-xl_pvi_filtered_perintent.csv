231,231,464,"Our son has been going to the same hair dresser for the past 3 or more years.  It's a familiar person and a familiar place.  It's a small boutique, so it's one client at a time.  We can close the door to be more private too.  She has a candy bowl and if he's good and sits, he can choose so many candies.  I have to spray his hair down first and comb it through (mommy's touch).  He doesn't like anyone else trying to delta glue his hair.  We have been consistent about getting his haircut.  It has been a work in progress.  When we first started, he would scream and squirm.  Little by little, we have worked up to a little boy who hops into that chair all on his own, gets the smock on and towel tucked in the back without any issues.  It's so nice.We've been consistent on the dentist as well and have taken him since he was a baby.  We actually have a dental appt. this afternoon today.  We've seen the same dentist now for 3-4 visits as our insurance changed two years ago.  This is a family practice, but it's more adult. There aren't cutie animal pics or children's videos like at his last pediatric dentist.  It's more formal and I bring the iPAD or a book.  We tell him what to expect: the dentist is going to count your teeth, brush them with a special toothbrush and flavor, and maybe take a picture.  Since learning about his sensory needs and compressions, we are going to massage his face this afternoon to get his body ready.  His mouth is sensitive.",0.0

235,235,464,"We have seen more imaginative play this past year than ever before.  At times, we hear him playing in his room and around the house with his figures.  At times, we can actually understand what he is saying and what scenario he is creating.  A few years ago, when he was just 3, it was more memorized dialog than anything else.  We had accumulated different Halloween costumes at one point and he started asking to wear them around the Ouse throughout the year.  Sure!  He and his brother would play dress up and that's really what sparked more of the imaginative play in our house that andThomas the train.  We had a train table at one point and the boys would be the characters and do scenes from some of the videos.  Again, older brother has helped to be such a good peer model for him.",0.0

The next night's sleep for all of us in the house would depend on how the previous night went.  It was exhausting!  This past Spring, we learned that our son needed more physical activity in the morning and compressions at night.  When we do this for him, he sleeps through the night and when we don't, he's up.  We have since switched his afternoon PT appt. to mornings because he was waking up every Tuesday night saying his legs hurt.  True, he was getting a workout and he was building muscle tone, but the effects were more of an awakening of the body and would last for hours.  Since the change to morning PT, we haven't had any issues.  Our son also sleeps with a weighted blanket upon recommendation from our OT and that is also helping.",0.0

Anytime when it starts to head south, we remind him that we area playing by the rules.  If he isn't going to play by the rules, then we don't play.  He likes to control the game.  For example, he LOVES to play Monopoly!  He sometimes starts to tell us what we can and cannot purchase, who we should be, and doesn't want to pay us if we land on his properties or go to jail if drawing that card or rolling three times.  Who wants to ever go to jail, right?  Still, it's important to relay this message every time we play and to work through it.

He goes to the grocery store (picks out his own doughnuts), knows what side the ""good"" carts are on, etc.  Before, I would have to get him that doughnut FIRST in order to quickly shop and make it to the checkout lane.  NOW, he gets his doughnut first, but I don't give it to him until I've shopped and we're back in the car OR made it home.  He will wait for it and that's huge!  For other stores like Target, we practice ""visiting"" the toy aisle, say the names of the toys he likes, and what they do and we leave.  It was hard as he would tantrum, but he'd recover quickly.

I try to be there for her but still make a point not push her towards independence.  Example: for family dance time she wants me to pick her up for dancing.
