He was beaming on the day of his first lesson.  He yelled out to us, ""I'm doing great!""  It is building his confidence and self-esteem.  More and more we are hearing him say that he is a big boy and that he is getting stronger.  There are a total of four riders in the group and the trainers are really good about having the riders interact with each other, greeting, and encouraging each other.  It's awesome!

It's a small boutique, so it's one client at a time.  We can close the door to be more private too.  She has a candy bowl and if he's good and sits, he can choose so many candies.  I have to spray his hair down first and comb it through (mommy's touch).  He doesn't like anyone else trying to delta glue his hair.  We have been consistent about getting his haircut.  It has been a work in progress.  When we first started, he would scream and squirm.  Little by little, we have worked up to a little boy who hops into that chair all on his own, gets the smock on and towel tucked in the back without any issues.  It's so nice.We've been consistent on the dentist as well and have taken him since he was a baby.  We actually have a dental appt. this afternoon today.  We've seen the same dentist now for 3-4 visits as our insurance changed two years ago.  This is a family practice, but it's more adult. There aren't cutie animal pics or children's videos like at his last pediatric dentist.  It's more formal and I bring the iPAD or a book.  We tell him what to expect: the dentist is going to count your teeth, brush them with a special toothbrush and flavor, and maybe take a picture.  Since learning about his sensory needs and compressions, we are going to massage his face this afternoon to get his body ready.

He goes to the grocery store (picks out his own doughnuts), knows what side the ""good"" carts are on, etc.  Before, I would have to get him that doughnut FIRST in order to quickly shop and make it to the checkout lane.  NOW, he gets his doughnut first, but I don't give it to him until I've shopped and we're back in the car OR made it home.  He will wait for it and that's huge!  For other stores like Target, we practice ""visiting"" the toy aisle, say the names of the toys he likes, and what they do and we leave.  It was hard as he would tantrum, but he'd recover quickly.  We used to treat them to an ice on the way out if no one freaked out.  They've since moved on to more cool things like chewing gum or Pokemon cards.  We don't treat every time, but when we do let them put something in the cart, they know that we are going to buy it.
