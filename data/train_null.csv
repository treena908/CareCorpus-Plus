We tell him what to expect: the dentist is going to count your teeth, brush them with a special toothbrush and flavor, and maybe take a picture.  Since learning about his sensory needs and compressions, we are going to massage his face this afternoon to get his body ready.  His mouth is sensitive.",

At times, we can actually understand what he is saying and what scenario he is creating.  A few years ago, when he was just 3, it was more memorized dialog than anything else.  We had accumulated different Halloween costumes at one point and he started asking to wear them around the Ouse throughout the year.  Sure!  He and his brother would play dress up and that's really what sparked more of the imaginative play in our house that andThomas the train.

This past Spring, we learned that our son needed more physical activity in the morning and compressions at night.  When we do this for him, he sleeps through the night and when we don't, he's up.  We have since switched his afternoon PT appt. to mornings because he was waking up every Tuesday night saying his legs hurt.  True, he was getting a workout and he was building muscle tone, but the effects were more of an awakening of the body and would last for hours.  Since the change to morning PT, we haven't had any issues.  Our son also sleeps with a weighted blanket upon recommendation from our OT and that is also helping.",

More and more we are hearing him say that he is a big boy and that he is getting stronger.  There are a total of four riders in the group and the trainers are really good about having the riders interact with each other, greeting, and encouraging each other.  It's awesome!

NOW, he gets his doughnut first, but I don't give it to him until I've shopped and we're back in the car OR made it home.  He will wait for it and that's huge!  For other stores like Target, we practice ""visiting"" the toy aisle, say the names of the toys he likes, and what they do and we leave.  It was hard as he would tantrum, but he'd recover quickly.

1429,0.0,139,We are always reading books to him. This is through out the day. He has his own book shelf that consist of about 100 stories that he has access to all the time. This allows him to bring us stories he is interested in., 
1430,0.0,139,We take him to all the parties he is invited to so he has more exposure to a social environment., 
1431,4.0,139,He comes home from Pre-School with a report of what was done at school that day. Since he can't say what he did this allows us a parents to know how to talk to him about his day at school., 
1432,0.0,139,Meal/snack time while playing it much more productive than forcing it at the table. He has a very hard time focusing and staying at the table or not throwing everything on the floor so allowing him to snack and play at the same time in a the same designated area helps., 
1433,0.0,139,We have the same routine every morning for school. , 
1434,0.0,139,We have a child safe home with clear boundaries. It allows our son who is extremely anxious when others come over to feel more confident in his home., 
1435,0.0,139,He has an IEP so he automatically qualified for bus transportation. This is a HUGE HELP!, 
1436,4.0,139,Waiting for cooler weather. It is too hot for most of the summer so we have to be choosy of when we go out., 
1437,0.0,139,When we go on trips outside of the home we make sure there is a place for our son to run and have sensory input., 
1438,2.0,139,We will use a fun silly voice instead of a bossy when we need his help to put away toys. He is much more likely to follow direction that way. , 
1439,0.0,139,The classroom size is small with lots of teacher assistants so he gets lots of one on one attention for tasks., 
1440,0.0,139,"Routine, routine, routine.", 
1441,4.0,139,Weather. Climate where we are is so very hot most of the year that when an activity and weather align we jump right on it., 
1442,0.0,139,We avoid highly crowded places during his time of the day when he normally is most stressed. He has a hard time with lots of noise and visual inputs so keeping those to only the minimum and at his well rested times is best., 
1443,0.0,139,Having only him go out with me instead of the whole family. The one and one seems to help defuse a lot of the stress that comes with going out., 
1444,0.0,139,We play along with games. We don't just interact but get to their level of play and treat their creativity as important as anything else., 
1445,0.0,139,We have three safe spaces in our home where the kids have pretty much full freedom to explore. This reduces the amount of times we have to tell him no through out the day. He shows a lot more progress in development when he has a kid safe space., 
1446,0.0,139,I turn on the radio every afternoon for about 30 or so minutes to allow all of us at home to kick back and have some fun while we play or clean. He sees this as a benefit and not a chore., 
1447,0.0,139,We always talk about the people we will see a few days before we actually see them. This I feel helps bring down his social anxiety a bit., 
1448,0.0,139,We read books to our son from the get go and have made sure that we carry many children books at home so the interests can continue and grow., 
1449,0.0,139,We have all these activities available at home so when the time comes to wanting to do it they are easily accessable., 
1450,0.0,139,Families that come over know ahead of time that our son will be more shy than other children. This preparation helps them not to judge him or push their own children on him when they arrive., 
1451,0.0,139,When we run errands we try to keep it to just our son going instead of his younger sister. This allows us to give him full focus., 
1452,0.0,139,This is a tough one. He doesn't speak much so the activities are very limited. I try regardless of how sad it does make me when he doesn't know how to engage to still take him to parties and get togethers. I know he can't improve without exposure., 
1453,0.0,139,From the very beginning we would read books every night. This is a huge trigger for him to understand it is time to go to bed. He immediately understands where he needs to go and what is going to happen. He is very cooperative in going to bed and is often very happy about it., 
1454,0.0,139,We get an update every day what happened at school. This helps us to ask him questions about his day since he can't communicate with us otherwise., 
1455,0.0,139,We avoid dining out. It is such a stressful situation for us as parents that our son quickly feeds off of our negativity., 
1456,0.0,139,If it is a sequence of events we will try and go back to where a step was missed, 
1457,4.0,139,We kept our son in a crib until just past 3 years of age. He never showed any want for change and I feel that established a great base for proper sleep and sleeping through the night., 
1458,0.0,139,We buy or ask as gifts educational toys that help with his sensory input needs., 
1459,0.0,139,Visual transitions, 
1460,0.0,139,We do art activities at home. He doesn't often want to do them in a structured way so doing it at home gives us the time to work with him on how to do a project correctly., 
1461,0.0,139,We just don't go out to eat anymore. It is too difficult to do as a family. I know he would do alright if it was the one on one time with a parents instead of the family., 
1462,0.0,139,Overnight visits/trips really need to be done with extra hands there to help. He does best when there are relatives whom he trusts and can't get some get one on one time with., 
1463,0.0,139,Field trips/events need to be kept short and with an outlet somewhere where he can get physical energy out, 
1464,4.0,139,"Again because of the weather water activities are a huge benefit. However, these need to be in quieter places with not so many kids running around.", 
1465,0.0,139,We can't make it out often where we are at because of the extreme heat so we make sure we get him out in our backyard to play with a variety of toys and activities, 
1466,0.0,139,We demonstrate group time at home as a family with other siblings daily. , 
1467,1.0,139,We try to get him to try new things whenever we can with lots of support and understanding from us. He gets very fearful of physical new experiences., 
1468,0.0,139,Places where he can move around freely. He wouldn't do well in a theater environment for example, 
1469,0.0,139,We always explain what we are doing so when we tell him what is coming up he is less likely to be upset when the change from one activity to another happens., 
1470,1.0,139,I will give my son a task that doesn't really need to be done but is harmless. Such as sweeping the floor and using the Swiffer duster., 
1471,0.0,139,We keep the community events to ones that have a constant change and give us freedom to move around.,

1996,1.0,77,We have also successfully taken an opposite approach where we stand off more and give her time and space to play independently or initiate an interaction on her own.

2001,1.0,77,The exact opposite is true in her music class.  She is much more shy and clingy.
