272,1153,139,We have numerous pets so we are constantly talking and demonstrating how to take care of them.,0.0
273,1144,139,We avoid highly crowded places during his time of the day when he normally is most stressed. He has a hard time with lots of noise and visual inputs so keeping those to only the minimum and at his well rested times is best.,0.0
274,1125,139,He hates the vacuum on but loves to check it out when off. We always let him help wrap the cord and put it away in the closet.,2.0
275,1130,139,Meal/snack time while playing it much more productive than forcing it at the table. He has a very hard time focusing and staying at the table or not throwing everything on the floor so allowing him to snack and play at the same time in a the same designated area helps.,0.0
276,1148,139,We do art activities at home. He doesn't often want to do them in a structured way so doing it at home gives us the time to work with him on how to do a project correctly.,0.0

279,1165,139,We try to invite families with other children over whenever possible. It is tiring but his socializing is a priority for us.,0.0
280,1136,139,The classroom size is small with lots of teacher assistants so he gets lots of one on one attention for tasks.,0.0
281,1146,139,We can't make it out often where we are at because of the extreme heat so we make sure we get him out in our backyard to play with a variety of toys and activities,0.0

288,1156,139,"We have toys and activities that are for ""emergency"" use only. That means they only come out when he needs a distraction and it will be an item he only sees every so once in a while. It feels like a new toy/activity to him.",0.0

293,1168,139,When we go on trips outside of the home we make sure there is a place for our son to run and have sensory input.,0.0
294,1116,139,Activities where children can be loud helps. He is usually a lot less self conscious.,0.0
295,1155,139,We have three safe spaces in our home where the kids have pretty much full freedom to explore. This reduces the amount of times we have to tell him no through out the day. He shows a lot more progress in development when he has a kid safe space.,0.0
296,1126,139,He loves trains so when he seems to be a little round up and destructive we make train sounds and he starts to pretend he is a train. This changes his whole attitude and it feels like a family activity.,2.0
297,1127,139,I turn on the radio every afternoon for about 30 or so minutes to allow all of us at home to kick back and have some fun while we play or clean. He sees this as a benefit and not a chore.,0.0

303,1157,139,We just don't go out to eat anymore. It is too difficult to do as a family. I know he would do alright if it was the one on one time with a parents instead of the family.,0.0
304,1137,139,This is a tough one. He doesn't speak much so the activities are very limited. I try regardless of how sad it does make me when he doesn't know how to engage to still take him to parties and get togethers. I know he can't improve without exposure.,0.0
305,1167,139,Weather. Climate where we are is so very hot most of the year that when an activity and weather align we jump right on it.,4.0
306,1151,139,We have all these activities available at home so when the time comes to wanting to do it they are easily accessable.,0.0

317,1166,139,We will use a fun silly voice instead of a bossy when we need his help to put away toys. He is much more likely to follow direction that way. ,2.0

325,1121,139,From the very beginning we would read books every night. This is a huge trigger for him to understand it is time to go to bed. He immediately understands where he needs to go and what is going to happen. He is very cooperative in going to bed and is often very happy about it.,0.0

We can close the door to be more private too.  She has a candy bowl and if he's good and sits, he can choose so many candies.  I have to spray his hair down first and comb it through (mommy's touch).  He doesn't like anyone else trying to delta glue his hair.  We have been consistent about getting his haircut.  It has been a work in progress.  When we first started, he would scream and squirm.  Little by little, we have worked up to a little boy who hops into that chair all on his own, gets the smock on and towel tucked in the back without any issues.  It's so nice.We've been consistent on the dentist as well and have taken him since he was a baby.  We actually have a dental appt. this afternoon today.  We've seen the same dentist now for 3-4 visits as our insurance changed two years ago.  This is a family practice, but it's more adult. There aren't cutie animal pics or children's videos like at his last pediatric dentist.  It's more formal and I bring the iPAD or a book.  We tell him what to expect: the dentist is going to count your teeth, brush them with a special toothbrush and flavor, and maybe take a picture.

He was beaming on the day of his first lesson.  He yelled out to us, ""I'm doing great!""  It is building his confidence and self-esteem.  More and more we are hearing him say that he is a big boy and that he is getting stronger.  There are a total of four riders in the group and the trainers are really good about having the riders interact with each other, greeting, and encouraging each other.  It's awesome!

In the past, it was only drive thru eating, banking, and post office.  In the past few years, we've gotten better about taking him OUT. He goes to the grocery store (picks out his own doughnuts), knows what side the ""good"" carts are on, etc.  Before, I would have to get him that doughnut FIRST in order to quickly shop and make it to the checkout lane.  NOW, he gets his doughnut first, but I don't give it to him until I've shopped and we're back in the car OR made it home.  He will wait for it and that's huge!  For other stores like Target, we practice ""visiting"" the toy aisle, say the names of the toys he likes, and what they do and we leave.  It was hard as he would tantrum, but he'd recover quickly.  We used to treat them to an ice on the way out if no one freaked out.  They've since moved on to more cool things like chewing gum or Pokemon cards.

He and his brother would play dress up and that's really what sparked more of the imaginative play in our house that andThomas the train.
