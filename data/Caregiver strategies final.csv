PROSPECT,77,"At gym class it can be as interactive or not as she feels like during open play.  She could easily go play where no other kids are or she could play in the thick of it and interact with other kids.  It's good practice for us to use our words with others (still a work in progress), wait in line and take turns, transition between activities so there is a lot of modeling, redirecting and praising good behavior.",classes and groups,community ,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROSPECT,77,"I model behavior for my daughter that I want to encourage.  Taking turns, saying hello, thank you, using hand sanitizer, etc.  She can be shy and slow to warm up in unfamiliar group situations so showing her that I'm having fun doing an activity seems to make her feel more comfortable to give it a try herself.",play,home,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PROSPECT,77,"I started her in swim class as a mommy and me type of class.  She was very comfortable and the instructors quickly recommended she move on to the next class with  me out of the water and her working with an instructor directly (not one on one, there is another child in the class but no parents).  I think giving her time away from me with another adult she can trust gives her a different sense of confidence and esteem.  ",classes and groups,community ,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PROSPECT,77,"She likes babies and likes to be helpful so if there is something she can do to help a  out, especially with a baby it's a reliable win.  It could be just entertaining the baby for a moment, handing something the parent requested, etc.",social,home,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PROSPECT,77,The exact opposite is true in her music class.  She is much more shy and clingy.  I do a mix of giving her space to run around when she lets loose but she definitely wants to stay close in that class.  It is also our newest class.  I try to be there for her but still make a point not push her towards independence.  Example: for family dance time she wants me to pick her up for dancing.  I may begin with that as I know she's not comfortable but after a short bit I put her down and I know she loves to spin so we spin together and she gradually works up to dancing more independently.  ,classes and groups,community ,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PROSPECT,77,"We don't do as much socialization as we probably would have pre-pandemic so our interactions with close friends and family (we don't have any family in the state) are pretty limited.  She goes to daycare 2 days a week, the other 3 week days we go to a scheduled class and over the weekend we may or may not see friends (lately it's been less so than over the summer).  She can be shy to initiate an interaction so sometimes sitting with her to play can help her get more comfortable before leaving her to play either by herself or with other kids.",social,home,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PROSPECT,77,We have also successfully taken an opposite approach where we stand off more and give her time and space to play independently or initiate an interaction on her own.  It does take longer than if we were directly guiding her but we want her to be comfortable without requiring our help 100% of the time.,social,home,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He knows where we keep the ice cream scoop, the juice, the frozen yogurt and fruit, the blender and cups.  He also likes to bake cookies, cakes, and cupcakes.  He likes to pour in the ingredients into the mixing bowl and scoop the batter into the cupcake tins.  He's getting quite good.  I think I have a little chef on my hands:).

This past Spring, we learned that our son needed more physical activity in the morning and compressions at night.  When we do this for him, he sleeps through the night and when we don't, he's up.  We have since switched his afternoon PT appt. to mornings because he was waking up every Tuesday night saying his legs hurt.  True, he was getting a workout and he was building muscle tone, but the effects were more of an awakening of the body and would last for hours.  Since the change to morning PT, we haven't had any issues.

SNF Supp.,464,"Our son has been going to the same hair dresser for the past 3 or more years.  It's a familiar person and a familiar place.  It's a small boutique, so it's one client at a time.  We can close the door to be more private too.  She has a candy bowl and if he's good and sits, he can choose so many candies.  I have to spray his hair down first and comb it through (mommy's touch).  He doesn't like anyone else trying to delta glue his hair.  We have been consistent about getting his haircut.  It has been a work in progress.  When we first started, he would scream and squirm.  Little by little, we have worked up to a little boy who hops into that chair all on his own, gets the smock on and towel tucked in the back without any issues.  It's so nice.We've been consistent on the dentist as well and have taken him since he was a baby.  We actually have a dental appt. this afternoon today.  We've seen the same dentist now for 3-4 visits as our insurance changed two years ago.  This is a family practice, but it's more adult. There aren't cutie animal pics or children's videos like at his last pediatric dentist.  It's more formal and I bring the iPAD or a book.  We tell him what to expect: the dentist is going to count your teeth, brush them with a special toothbrush and flavor, and maybe take a picture.

SNF Supp.,464,"Playing board games and learning to play nicely with others (with sibling, parent, hab provider, other kids) is a work in progress.  We are working on taking turns, sharing, encouraging others, not leaving the game, working through frustrating moments, being a good sport, and not controlling the game.  Anytime when it starts to head south, we remind him that we area playing by the rules.  If he isn't going to play by the rules, then we don't play.  He likes to control the game.  For example, he LOVES to play Monopoly!  He sometimes starts to tell us what we can and cannot purchase, who we should be, and doesn't want to pay us if we land on his properties or go to jail if drawing that card or rolling three times.  Who wants to ever go to jail, right?  Still, it's important to relay this message every time we play and to work through it.  At times, when he isn't willing, we decide to all clean up the game and try something else (and we respect that).",play,home,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's once a week on Tuesday evenings around 7:15 p.m.  We arrive around 7:00 and he knows that he has to be fitted for his helmet first, then wait with one of us by the sign for a trainer to come and get him.  He was beaming on the day of his first lesson.  He yelled out to us, ""I'm doing great!""  It is building his confidence and self-esteem.  More and more we are hearing him say that he is a big boy and that he is getting stronger.  There are a total of four riders in the group and the trainers are really good about having the riders interact with each other, greeting, and encouraging each other.  It's awesome!  We are going to do this activity all year long.  If we can get two lessons a week we will.  He loves it!",classes and groups,community,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We write out the list the morning of or night before and he checks them off as he completes them (he numbers them too).  I bring it with us to our in-clinic therapies and I've offered copies to his other therapists to use if needed.  Sometimes they tell me it wasn't necessary and other times they use it and he does great.  The checklist/picture schedule helps reduce our son's stress and anxiety.

SNF Supp.,464,"We have seen more imaginative play this past year than ever before.  At times, we hear him playing in his room and around the house with his figures.  At times, we can actually understand what he is saying and what scenario he is creating.  A few years ago, when he was just 3, it was more memorized dialog than anything else.  We had accumulated different Halloween costumes at one point and he started asking to wear them around the Ouse throughout the year.  Sure!  He and his brother would play dress up and that's really what sparked more of the imaginative play in our house that andThomas the train.  We had a train table at one point and the boys would be the characters and do scenes from some of the videos.

We do family movie night quite a bit, but we don't make him earn that.  That's a family activity.  The boys are always wanting a turn on the iPAD and at times, we admit that we give in just to have a break ourselves.

SNF Supp.,464,"Well, we do tend to do more fast food than anything else.  He calls it ""window food"" which is so appropriate and true, it does come out to us via a window.  In the past, it was only drive thru eating, banking, and post office.  In the past few years, we've gotten better about taking him OUT. He goes to the grocery store (picks out his own doughnuts), knows what side the ""good"" carts are on, etc.  Before, I would have to get him that doughnut FIRST in order to quickly shop and make it to the checkout lane.  NOW, he gets his doughnut first, but I don't give it to him until I've shopped and we're back in the car OR made it home.  He will wait for it and that's huge!  For other stores like Target, we practice ""visiting"" the toy aisle, say the names of the toys he likes, and what they do and we leave.  It was hard as he would tantrum, but he'd recover quickly.  We used to treat them to an ice on the way out if no one freaked out.  They've since moved on to more cool things like chewing gum or Pokemon cards.  We don't treat every time, but when we do let them put something in the cart, they know that we are going to buy it.
