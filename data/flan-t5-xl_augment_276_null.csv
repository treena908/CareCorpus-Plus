1051,0,77,"We don't do as much socialization as we probably would have pre-pandemic so our interactions with close friends and family (we don't have any family in the state) are pretty limited.  She goes to daycare 2 days a week, the other 3 week days we go to a scheduled class and over the weekend we may or may not see friends (lately it's been less so than over the summer).  She can be shy to initiate an interaction so sometimes sitting with her to play can help her get more comfortable before leaving her to play either by herself or with other kids.", 
1052,1,77,The exact opposite is true in her music class.  She is much more shy and clingy.  I do a mix of giving her space to run around when she lets loose but she definitely wants to stay close in that class.  It is also our newest class.  I try to be there for her but still make a point not push her towards independence.  Example: for family dance time she wants me to pick her up for dancing.  I may begin with that as I know she's not comfortable but after a short bit I put her down and I know she loves to spin so we spin together and she gradually works up to dancing more independently.  , 
1053,2,77,"She likes babies and likes to be helpful so if there is something she can do to help a  out, especially with a baby it's a reliable win.  It could be just entertaining the baby for a moment, handing something the parent requested, etc.", 
1054,1,77,We have also successfully taken an opposite approach where we stand off more and give her time and space to play independently or initiate an interaction on her own.  It does take longer than if we were directly guiding her but we want her to be comfortable without requiring our help 100% of the time., 
1055,0,77,"At gym class it can be as interactive or not as she feels like during open play.  She could easily go play where no other kids are or she could play in the thick of it and interact with other kids.  It's good practice for us to use our words with others (still a work in progress), wait in line and take turns, transition between activities so there is a lot of modeling, redirecting and praising good behavior.", 
1056,1,77,"I also give verbal instructions and try to praise her actions that I would like to encourage.  Thank you for sharing the slide, I'm proud you waited your turn I know that takes patience, etc.", 
1057,0,77,"I model behavior for my daughter that I want to encourage.  Taking turns, saying hello, thank you, using hand sanitizer, etc.  She can be shy and slow to warm up in unfamiliar group situations so showing her that I'm having fun doing an activity seems to make her feel more comfortable to give it a try herself.", 
1058,0,77,"I started her in swim class as a mommy and me type of class.  She was very comfortable and the instructors quickly recommended she move on to the next class with  me out of the water and her working with an instructor directly (not one on one, there is another child in the class but no parents).  I think giving her time away from me with another adult she can trust gives her a different sense of confidence and esteem.  ",

1785,0,139,Overnight visits/trips really need to be done with extra hands there to help. He does best when there are relatives whom he trusts and can't get some get one on one time with., 
1786,0,139,Meal/snack time while playing it much more productive than forcing it at the table. He has a very hard time focusing and staying at the table or not throwing everything on the floor so allowing him to snack and play at the same time in a the same designated area helps., 
1787,0,139,When we run errands we try to keep it to just our son going instead of his younger sister. This allows us to give him full focus., 
1788,4,139,"Again because of the weather water activities are a huge benefit. However, these need to be in quieter places with not so many kids running around.", 
1789,4,139,We kept our son in a crib until just past 3 years of age. He never showed any want for change and I feel that established a great base for proper sleep and sleeping through the night., 
1790,0,139,We have family and guests over quite often with children ranging in age. , 
1791,4,139,Waiting for cooler weather. It is too hot for most of the summer so we have to be choosy of when we go out., 
1792,0,139,"We have toys and activities that are for ""emergency"" use only. That means they only come out when he needs a distraction and it will be an item he only sees every so once in a while. It feels like a new toy/activity to him.", 
1793,0,139,Plans need to be avoided and when traveling a pack and play is still needed for quality of sleep. He is unable to rest otherwise even though he sleeps in a normal bed at home., 
1794,4,139,Weather. Climate where we are is so very hot most of the year that when an activity and weather align we jump right on it., 
1795,0,139,I turn on the radio every afternoon for about 30 or so minutes to allow all of us at home to kick back and have some fun while we play or clean. He sees this as a benefit and not a chore., 
1796,0,139,We have a child safe home with clear boundaries. It allows our son who is extremely anxious when others come over to feel more confident in his home., 
1797,0,139,Having only him go out with me instead of the whole family. The one and one seems to help defuse a lot of the stress that comes with going out., 
1798,0,139,We have the same routine every morning for school. , 
1799,0,139,We always talk about the people we will see a few days before we actually see them. This I feel helps bring down his social anxiety a bit., 
1800,0,139,This is a tough one. He doesn't speak much so the activities are very limited. I try regardless of how sad it does make me when he doesn't know how to engage to still take him to parties and get togethers. I know he can't improve without exposure., 
1801,0,139,We just don't go out to eat anymore. It is too difficult to do as a family. I know he would do alright if it was the one on one time with a parents instead of the family., 
1802,0,139,We always explain what we are doing so when we tell him what is coming up he is less likely to be upset when the change from one activity to another happens., 
1803,0,139,We demonstrate group time at home as a family with other siblings daily. , 
1804,0,139,Everything has its place so if I ask him to put something away he knows where it goes., 
1805,0,139,We try out new venues when something comes available in our town. , 
1806,0,139,He has an IEP so he automatically qualified for bus transportation. This is a HUGE HELP!, 
1807,4,139,He comes home from Pre-School with a report of what was done at school that day. Since he can't say what he did this allows us a parents to know how to talk to him about his day at school., 
1808,0,139,We have all these activities available at home so when the time comes to wanting to do it they are easily accessable., 
1809,0,139,We can't make it out often where we are at because of the extreme heat so we make sure we get him out in our backyard to play with a variety of toys and activities, 
1810,0,139,Field trips/events need to be kept short and with an outlet somewhere where he can get physical energy out, 
1811,1,139,I will give my son a task that doesn't really need to be done but is harmless. Such as sweeping the floor and using the Swiffer duster., 
1812,0,139,Activities where children can be loud helps. He is usually a lot less self conscious., 
1813,1,139,We try to get him to try new things whenever we can with lots of support and understanding from us. He gets very fearful of physical new experiences., 
1814,0,139,Places where he can move around freely. He wouldn't do well in a theater environment for example, 
1815,0,139,We have three safe spaces in our home where the kids have pretty much full freedom to explore. This reduces the amount of times we have to tell him no through out the day. He shows a lot more progress in development when he has a kid safe space., 
1816,0,139,We have numerous pets so we are constantly talking and demonstrating how to take care of them., 
1817,0,139,We avoid dining out. It is such a stressful situation for us as parents that our son quickly feeds off of our negativity., 
1818,0,139,From the very beginning we would read books every night. This is a huge trigger for him to understand it is time to go to bed. He immediately understands where he needs to go and what is going to happen. He is very cooperative in going to bed and is often very happy about it., 
1819,0,139,We avoid highly crowded places during his time of the day when he normally is most stressed. He has a hard time with lots of noise and visual inputs so keeping those to only the minimum and at his well rested times is best., 
1820,0,139,We get an update every day what happened at school. This helps us to ask him questions about his day since he can't communicate with us otherwise., 
1821,0,139,We keep the community events to ones that have a constant change and give us freedom to move around., 
1822,0,139,The classroom size is small with lots of teacher assistants so he gets lots of one on one attention for tasks., 
1823,0,139,Visual transitions, 
1824,2,139,He hates the vacuum on but loves to check it out when off. We always let him help wrap the cord and put it away in the closet., 
1825,0,139,If it is a sequence of events we will try and go back to where a step was missed, 
1826,0,139,We are always reading books to him. This is through out the day. He has his own book shelf that consist of about 100 stories that he has access to all the time. This allows him to bring us stories he is interested in., 
1827,0,856,We have a stander that we put him in daily to help build strength, 
1828,0,856,We have therapy Monday thru Thursday. They teach how to work with him and try different techniques, 
1829,0,856,WE read to him, 
1830,4,856,My child is 19 months old with severe muscle and cognitive delay. We will like him to participate more by wanting and knowing how to help us help him but I am not sure how to do this. ,
