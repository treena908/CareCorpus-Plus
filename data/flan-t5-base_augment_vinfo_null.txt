77	0.0	We don't do as much socialization as we probably would have pre-pandemic so our interactions with close friends and family (we don't have any family in the state) are pretty limited.  She goes to daycare 2 days a week, the other 3 week days we go to a scheduled class and over the weekend we may or may not see friends (lately it's been less so than over the summer).  She can be shy to initiate an interaction so sometimes sitting with her to play can help her get more comfortable before leaving her to play either by herself or with other kids.	 	1.714221479260088	0	True
77	1.0	The exact opposite is true in her music class.  She is much more shy and clingy.  I do a mix of giving her space to run around when she lets loose but she definitely wants to stay close in that class.  It is also our newest class.  I try to be there for her but still make a point not push her towards independence.  Example: for family dance time she wants me to pick her up for dancing.  I may begin with that as I know she's not comfortable but after a short bit I put her down and I know she loves to spin so we spin together and she gradually works up to dancing more independently.  	 	2.3966527873097885	0	False
77	2.0	She likes babies and likes to be helpful so if there is something she can do to help a  out, especially with a baby it's a reliable win.  It could be just entertaining the baby for a moment, handing something the parent requested, etc.	 	2.7784193685741783	0	False
77	1.0	We have also successfully taken an opposite approach where we stand off more and give her time and space to play independently or initiate an interaction on her own.  It does take longer than if we were directly guiding her but we want her to be comfortable without requiring our help 100% of the time.	 	2.3966527873097885	0	False
77	0.0	At gym class it can be as interactive or not as she feels like during open play.  She could easily go play where no other kids are or she could play in the thick of it and interact with other kids.  It's good practice for us to use our words with others (still a work in progress), wait in line and take turns, transition between activities so there is a lot of modeling, redirecting and praising good behavior.	 	1.714221479260088	0	True
77	1.0	I also give verbal instructions and try to praise her actions that I would like to encourage.  Thank you for sharing the slide, I'm proud you waited your turn I know that takes patience, etc.	 	2.3966527873097885	0	False
77	0.0	I model behavior for my daughter that I want to encourage.  Taking turns, saying hello, thank you, using hand sanitizer, etc.  She can be shy and slow to warm up in unfamiliar group situations so showing her that I'm having fun doing an activity seems to make her feel more comfortable to give it a try herself.	 	1.714221479260088	0	True
77	0.0	I started her in swim class as a mommy and me type of class.  She was very comfortable and the instructors quickly recommended she move on to the next class with  me out of the water and her working with an instructor directly (not one on one, there is another child in the class but no parents).  I think giving her time away from me with another adult she can trust gives her a different sense of confidence and esteem.  	 	1.714221479260088	0	True
77	2.0	For actions that I do not wish to encourage I try to model what I would like to see and verbally redirect.  Please use your words instead of your hands, etc.	 	2.7784193685741783	0	False
