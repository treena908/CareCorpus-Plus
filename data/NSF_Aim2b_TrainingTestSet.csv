27,LEICSO,,19,"On overnight trips out of town, we try to keep certain routines (such as naps and bedtimes) consistent with what we do at home, to help River feel at ease and maintain his normal schedule",,x,,,,
28,LEICSO,,19,"On the rare occasions when we take River out to a restaurant, we try to make sure he has a fun activity to do before the food comes, and after the meal ends. For example, I'll bring a train or car into the restaurant with us, and let him play with it or run around outside while we're waiting for food.",,,,x,,
29,LEICSO,,19,"River enjoys helping his parents make coffee in the morning. He takes down the pack of filters, puts the filter in the basket, helps Mommy or Daddy scoop the grounds into the filter and pour the water into the coffee maker, closes the lid and presses the 'on' button. He loves doing this and will act offended and complain if we make the coffee without him.",,,x,,,
30,LEICSO,,19,"River is not a great eater. In order to entice him to eat more of a meal, we've done everything from the 'airplane game,' where every bite of food is a different friend or family member flying on an airplane to visit us, to cheering him as a 'champion' for every successful bite of food to outright bribery (we'll sing the Zoo song again, if you take another bite).     These are successful strategies in that they do entice him to eat more, but I'm not sure whether they are ultimately doing more harm than good, in that they take a lot of energy, time and attention, and don't encourage him to be more independent about eating, or learn how to enjoy eating food for itself, without the associated fun.",,,,x,,
31,LEICSO,,19,"River LOVES trains. His grandparents bought him a train set for Hanukah, and he plays with it intensely every day, piecing together tracks, moving train cars around and around and up and down, playing pretend train with almost any objects he can get his hands on.     We've responded to  this interest by finding and reading books about trains, singing songs about trains, and taking trips to the nearby train overpass and train stations to watch trains",,,,x,,

We don't do this very often, but I would like to start doing it more - the older he gets the more helpful he can be.",,,x,,,

34,LEICSO,,19,"We brush our teeth together in the mornings. He often enjoys doing things together and emulating adults. He especially likes the rare occasions when we can all brush our teeth together as a family (Mommy, Daddy and baby)",,x,,,,

39,LEICSO,,19,"We have encouraged River to do arts and crafts by providing him with a small table and chairs where he does his 'scribbling' with crayons. When the weather is nice, sometimes we use fingerpaints in the backyard.     We also sometimes draw with chalk, either on the sidewalk, or on a small chalkboard. River enjoys when I draw the head and body of a spider for him, so he can draw in the legs.",,,x,,,
40,LEICSO,,19,"We have read to River every day since he was a mere handful of weeks old. At this point, he loves books and will demand that we read them several times a day.     We have incorporated reading into our routines for naptime and bedtime, and will ask River to pick out the book or books he wants to read. He is usually very excited to do this, and very excited to read the books. We also try to take out a new stack of books from the library every few weeks, which I let him help pick out, and seek out books on topics that he is particularly interested in, such as trains and gorillas.",,,,x,,
41,LEICSO,,19,"We like to take River hiking. We'll start out with him in the backpack, but after a short while, he's usually itching to get out and climb around the rocks on his own. We'll support him physically, as needed, as he does this.",,x,,,,
42,LEICSO,,19,"We make frequent playdates with friends, and at the beginning and end of each playdate, I always try to emphasize greeting the friends and saying goodbye at the end, and encourage River to do the same.",,x,,,,
