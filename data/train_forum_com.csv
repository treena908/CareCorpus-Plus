She could easily go play where no other kids are or she could play in the thick of it and interact with other kids.

707,25,77,The exact opposite is true in her music class.  She is much more shy and clingy.  I do a mix of giving her space to run around when she lets loose but she definitely wants to stay close in that class.  It is also our newest class.  I try to be there for her but still make a point not push her towards independence.  Example: for family dance time she wants me to pick her up for dancing.  I may begin with that as I know she's not comfortable but after a short bit I put her down and I know she loves to spin so we spin together and she gradually works up to dancing more independently.  ,1.0
708,27,77,We have also successfully taken an opposite approach where we stand off more and give her time and space to play independently or initiate an interaction on her own.

I think giving her time away from me with another adult she can trust gives her a different sense of confidence and esteem.  ",0.0
712,26,77,"We don't do as much socialization as we probably would have pre-pandemic so our interactions with close friends and family (we don't have any family in the state) are pretty limited.  She goes to daycare 2 days a week, the other 3 week days we go to a scheduled class and over the weekend we may or may not see friends (lately it's been less so than over the summer).  She can be shy to initiate an interaction so sometimes sitting with her to play can help her get more comfortable before leaving her to play either by herself or with other kids.",0.0
